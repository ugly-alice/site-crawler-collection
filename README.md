# site-crawler-collection
A collection of site crawlers writter in popular languages.

#### Important note: please, do not make fun of me, I'm started to learn programming November, 2015.

Currently it have only one site supported: Tapastic.

You should add a link to the comic and a folder name to store images, then just run the script.
Now it's some monkey code, but I'll of course improve it every day.

I've always hated all ugly, heavily designed comic and gallery sites, tenting me to download megabytes of javascript and advertisement that often breaks through adblockers with my 3G/EDGE internet connection, so I've decided to make some simple utilities that'll crawl some comic sites for me to read them offline, just for QUICK and NON-OBTRUSIVE access to liked comics.

In the future, I'll do those things:
- add more sites
- create and use a local sqlite database for storing data (will be useful to not download duplicates and update local collection functions)
- add debug and make code more object-oriented and good
- add some extra scripts that duplicates the functions but written in other languages (basically it'll be PHP, Python 2/3 and Ruby 2)
- add a local html file to browse comics with AN AWESOME SPEED NOT THAT LAGGY SITES THAT HOSTS COMICS oh god, that was very emotional + adding some useful functions
- integrate with some offline comic storing applications
